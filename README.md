## Description

This project involved setting up a Blogging Website, that would aggregate Users blogs and display them on a blog-posts page.

## User Story

As a Marketing Student, I wanted to make a Personal Blog where I could shared my thoughts and experiences.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The landing page contains a form with labels and inputs for Username, Blog title and Blog Content.
- Submitting the form saves the data to localstorage and redirects user to the blog posts page.
- Trying to submit the form without any data results in a message prompting the user to complete the form.
- The website offers functionality for Dark/Light Mode.
- Pressing the back button on the Blog Posts page takes you back to the landing page where you can input more Blog Entries.
- On the blogposts page we can see a list of posts that are pulled from Local Storage.
- When we view the local storage via the console, a JSON array of blog postg objects including authors username, title of popst and the posts contents is displayed.
- Each blog entry shows the tiotle, the content and the author of the post.
- The footer presents a link to my portfolio website.
